# Unit 3: Performance Assessment

Why did you pick this API topic?

I picked this API topic because I go to the gym everyday so all the information came to me natural and I didn't really need to think much when creating the planning doc.

Describe your API and the available data endpoints

My API is supposed to give a variety of workouts so the user can pick from and do themselves.
"/" introduces the user to the website, "/docs" tells the user the endpoints they need for the data. "/api/workouts" Gives the user all the workouts they can do incase they don't want to find a specific one. "/api/workouts/:id" Will give the user a specific workout based on the id they pick.


How was your experience building your own API server after using other APIs as a client in Unit 2?

It feels annoying and I hope I can continue to use APIs created by others instead of creating them myself. I find it nice but it is tedious.
